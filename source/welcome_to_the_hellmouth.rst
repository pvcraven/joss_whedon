Welcome to the Hellmouth
========================

* Go over our syllabus

Class One
---------

The goal of the first assignment is to:

* Practice taking notes and turning that into an outline so you write a better paper, faster
* Practice writing paragraphs

Assignment One
--------------

* Select five characters in the episode we are about to watch
* Write one paragraph on each character
* No need for introduction, conclusion, or transition.
* Structure of each paragraph:

  * Purpose sentence (Name, who are they, what stereotype/purpose do they hold)
  * Analysis (Talk more about the purpose/motivation of character)
  * Supporting evidence (Support)

* In each paragraph:

  * What role is that character set up for?
  * What stereo-type?
  * Have you found people fix stereo types like this in school?
  * Shoot for about five sentences

How to Make Assignment One Easy
-------------------------------

* Outlining

  * Purpose is to save time and effort - NOT add more work
  * You know what you are writing about, write quick notes about
    the characters as you watch. Then the paragraphs should practically write themselves.

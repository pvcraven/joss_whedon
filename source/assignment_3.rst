Assignment 3
============

Watch one of the two episodes:

* :ref:`lie_to_me` - Touches on the consequences of lying to people you care
  about, and even wanting people to lie to you.
* :ref:`innocence` - This parallels the experiences of having sex with
  someone you love, only afterwards to realize you've been used. This may
  be triggering, so avoid this episode if needed.

Write about one of the following topics:

* It is often easier to choose immediate self-interest over a course of
  action that is better long-term and for everyone involved. In :ref:`lie_to_me`
  people find it easier to just lie. Explain how this episode parallels
  real-life issues. Why is doing the right thing hard?
  How can we encourage ourselves to be truthful? As a society, how do we
  encourate others to tell the truth?
* In :ref:`innocence`, the show parallels the common experience of a bad
  sex experience. Explain how it does this. Discuss why we create and watch
  shows that mirror experiences like this. Who wants to re-live this? Why?

Look for an introduction, about four main points (paragraph for each), and a
conclusion. Make sure to create a quick outline so you know your points and
the supporting statements for those points.

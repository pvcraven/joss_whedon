Short Essay - Assignment 3
==========================

For this assignment, we'll be outlining and writing a short essay.

Pick one of the following episodes and discussion topics:

Lie to Me
---------

:ref:`lie_to_me` - This episode touches on the consequences of lying to people
you care about. Even wanting people to lie to you.

It is often easier to choose immediate self-interest over a course of
action that is better long-term and for everyone involved. In :ref:`lie_to_me`
people find it easier to just lie.

Writing prompts:

* Who in this show lies to whom? Is anyone here not lying?
* Explain how this episode parallels real-life issues people have.
* In this show, there are people that want to turn into vampires. Is there anything
  that could be a metaphor for in real life? Some of these people don't want
  to be saved. Does this type of thing really happen?
* "Other viewpoints than yours may be valid." When is that true? When is that not true?
* "Some lies are necessary, the truth is worse." True or not?
* "I love you. I don't know if I trust you." Is trust part of love?
* Why is doing/saying the truth so hard for the people in the show?
* How can we encourage ourselves to be truthful? As a society, how do we
  encourage others to tell the truth?

* "Nothing’s ever simple anymore. I'm constantly trying to work it out. Who to love or hate. Who to trust. It’s just, like, the more I know, the more confused I get."
* "I believe that's called growing up."
* "I’d like to stop then, okay?"

Innocence
---------

:ref:`innocence` is the second of a two-part episode. The first episode being
"Surprise" (which I did post, in case you want to watch it too.)
In short, the story is that Angel is a vampire that is cursed with
a soul so he feels empathy.
(The curse came from a band of Gypsies that Ms. Calendar is part of.)
That curse stays until he experiences a moment of
true happiness. At the end of the first part, Buffy and Angel have sex, and
unbeknownst to Buffy, Angel loses his soul.

Oh, and bad-vampires Spike and Drusilla are working to assemble a bad demon
named "Judge." Drusilla is healthy again, Spice almost died and is in a wheelchair.

**Trigger Warning:** This episode hits on experiences where a person changes
after sex, and one person feels used. If you've had some sexual trauma in your
background you might want to pick the other episode.

Writing prompts:

* Explain how in :ref:`innocence`, the show parallels the common experience of
  a bad sex experience.
* Discuss why we create and watch shows that mirror experiences like this.
  Who wants to re-live this? Why?
* The Judge says there is no humanity in Angel. What is humanity?
* What's up with Oz's response to Willow?
* Giles is dating Ms. Jenny Calendar. When he realizes what she's done, he
  has to pick sides. Buffy or his romantic interest. Does this type of thing
  happen often?
* After sex, Buffy says to Giles, "You must have been so disappointed in me."
  How does Giles respond, and how does that mirror a typical parent/teen
  relationship?
* What must it be like moving from an "innocent" relationship with your parent
  and peers, and one where you are now discussing sex?

Directions on Writing
---------------------

* First, create an outline with at least four main points.
* For each point, pull *specific* things that pack your point. Don't give me
  something vague, pull an actual event or fact. Even better, two or
  three.
* Outline a conclusion. How do your points relate? How do they build off each other?
* Leave the outline on top, I'll be looking for it.
* Use that outline to write your essay. Six paragraphs: intro with thesis, four points, conclusion.

===============================

Take a look at these discussion questions before watching "Welcome to the Hellmouth."
Also take a look at the assignment :ref:`paragraph-writing`.
Set yourself up to take notes for the assignment. Also, be ready to discuss
the questions below, in class.

"Welcome to the Hellmouth" is a two-part episode. The assignment and questions
here only require watching the first part, but I recommend watching the second
part as well.

* Why are TV shows and movies often centered around high school?
* The opening scene had a girl and guy breaking into the school.
  In what way is it a twist on a classic scene?
* Buffy is the 'new girl' at the school.

  * What did the show get right about how that feels?
  * Did the show get things wrong?
  * What was unusual about Buffy's situation?
    Particularly with the stake and Buffy/principal interaction?

* Everyone has those lovely awkward conversations, particularly when trying to
  start a conversation with someone new. Joss tries to show this in the show.
  What interactions come across awkwardly? Such as Buffy with her mom, Xander
  with Buffy, school hallway interactions.

  * What advice would you give a new teen on how to handle and get past awkward
    conversations?

* Popularity in high school - Buffy has to find her spot in school. What social
  structures existed in your school?

  * Cordelia's quizzing of Buffy to find her social ranking.
  * Also with Cordelia, fit in by "Know your losers."
  * This was pre-social media. Have things changed?

* What abilities does Buffy have?
* What is a "slayer"?
* What did the show do to make it seem like the mom/Buffy relationship was,
  believable?
* What purpose does "The Bronze" serve in the show? Did you have anything that
  served that purpose in high school?
* What was the point of showing the whole "missed wave" scene in the bronze?
* Willow -- how does the show set up her personality?
* The show works a lot with the confidence people have in themselves.
  What is the difference between the self-confidence people show in Buffy? How
  does it differ depending on the person, and the situation? Where is Buffy
  confident? Where is she not? Is Cordelia as confident as she lets on?
* Another theme in this show is finding your place in the world. What factors
  make that so difficult?

    * People often feel "trapped" with their place in the
      world. What factors cause that?

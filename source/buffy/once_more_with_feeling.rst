    anyone beforehand about their attempt.

Themes
------

Relationships (romantic, platonic, family) take maintenance. Not every relationship
is going to survive this episode. Lack of communication is a common theme here.
When secrets finally come out, it can be too late to heal the damage.

Discuss

* What causes a person to just 'go through the motions?'

  * How do you get out of that mindset?

* What leads to a healthy relationship? How does communication play a part
  of that?
* Giles feels the need to leave Buffy, so that she's forced to grow and be independent.

  * In what way to our parents/mentors stop us from growing?
  * What are the risks of letting our kids go off on their own?
  * What is the best way of striking the balance between helping a twenty-year-old,
    and letting them grow on their own?

* Tara's only family is now the Scooby gang.

  * Should she leave Willow?
  * If she stays, how can she enforce boundaries?
  * If she leaves, does she have a family?
  * If she leaves Willow, can she stay as part of that family?
  * Should Willow be cast out of the group?

* "The hardest thing in this world is to live in it."

  * What does this mean?
  * Do you agree?

* What do the lyrics below try to say?

```
Life's not a song
Life isn't bliss
Life is just this
It's living
You'll get along
The pain that you feel
You only can heal
By living

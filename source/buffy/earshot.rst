S03E18 Earshot
==============

Trigger warnings: suicide and mass shooting.

Buffy: "You know what? I was wrong. You are an idiot. My life happens to, on
occasion, suck beyond the telling of it. Sometimes more than I can handle. It's
not just mine. Every single person down there is ignoring your pain because
they're too busy dealing with their own. The beautiful ones. The popular ones.
The guys that pick on you. Everyone. If you could hear what they are feeling.
The loneliness. The confusion. It looks quiet down there. Its not. Its deafening."

Oz: "I am my thoughts. If they exist in her, Buffy contains everything that is
me and she becomes me and I cease to exist. Hmm."

Out of Sight, Out of Mind
=========================

Buffy is about taking "monsters" you encounter in high school and making them real
life monsters that Buffy and the Scooby gang fight.

In this episode, the monster is the feeling of being alone and ignored by other
people in high school.

Before watching this episode, read through the :ref:`short-essay` assignment.

Discussion Points
-----------------

* Opening scene, Buffy gets made fun of after bumping into Cordelia for being weird
* "Anger of the outcast" - Shakespeare "Merchant of Venice" Schylock, "prick me, I bleed" (Maybe look this up?)
* Cordelia Chase : People who think their problems are so huge craze me, like this time I sort of ran over this girl on her bike. It was the most traumatizing event of my life, and she's trying to make it about her leg, like my pain meant nothing.
* Teacher congratulating Cordelia, even if her stuff was bad
* Willow and Xander, laughing about inside joke, and "you had to be there"
  leaving new girl out.
* Cordelia and Harmony react aggressively when Marcie tries in engage in conversation
* What would you do if you could turn invisible? Scoobies discuss.
* Wonderful power to possess. "I don't know, looking in the mirror every day and seeing nothing there"
* Popular people saying the same thing you do, and getting laughs "did you check out that toupe?"
* 'Have a nice summer?' commend in yearbook -- kiss of death.
* "People perceived Marcie as invisible, so she became so"
* Not getting called on in class
* Cordilia - "I know we have differences and all, with you being weird and hanging out with
  these losers"
* "It's all about me"
* I don't care what it is, just get rid of it.

* Cordelia Chase : Hey, you think I'm never lonely because I'm so cute and
  popular? I can be surrounded by people and be completely alone. It's not like
  any of them really know me. I don't even know if they like me half the time...
  People just want to be in a popular zone. Sometimes when I talk... everyone's
  so busy agreeing with me, they don't hear a word I say.
* Buffy Summers : Well, if you feel so alone, then why do you work so hard at being popular?
* Cordelia Chase : Well, it beats being alone all by yourself.

* Suffering turns people loony?
* Someone saves your life, and still not going to join their social group
* What would you do if you were invisible?
* What makes this show "dated"? How is it different than what would happen today?

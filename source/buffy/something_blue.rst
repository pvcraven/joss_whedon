S04E09 - Something Blue
=======================

Willow is upset that boyfriend Oz has left.
Explain what happened to Spike.

Spike is being held captive. He had been kidnapped by mysterious commandos.

Buffy is interested in Riley.
Ever practice a conversation so much you think it already happened?
Buffy realizes she likes 'bad boy.'
Can a nice safe relationship be that good? Can it be passionite?

"I feel like I've been split down the center and half of me is lost."

Willow, sad about breakup, brings down mood of group.

"We all have pain Will."

"I just can't stand feeling this way. I want it to be over."

(Oh, please don't cast spells in the college bathroom.)

What if everything you wished came true?

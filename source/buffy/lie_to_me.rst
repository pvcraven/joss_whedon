Lie to Me
=========

Before watching this episode, make sure you've followed the plot enough to know
who Druscilla and Spike are.

While watching the show, track who is lying to whom?
List lies that occur during show. Does anyone not lie?

In the opening scene, Buffy sees Druscilla and Angel talking. She doesn't
see the whole conversation, and hears a quote out of context.
"This can't go on, it has to stop." She doesn't tell Angel about this right away.
Is this untruthful? Why doesn't she ask about it right away? In similar
situations, how can things go good/bad if you do bring up concerns with your
partner immediately?

Who is Billy Ford?

There's a pop culture reference to the 1990 song
`I touch myself <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv-34w8kGPM>`.

In this show there are people wanting to be killed by vampires,
and then turned into vampires.
Are there any parallels to this in real life?

The quote "Other viewpoints than yours may be valid," this can be legitimate,
or possible not. How do you know when a different viewpoint is valid, and when
it is not?

"Some lies are necessary, the truth is worse." Is this the case? If it is, then
how do you know when the truth is worse?

"I love you, I don't know if I trust you." Isn't trust part of love? How can this
be the case? How important is the truth in a relationship? If it is important,
why do people lie so often?

When someone that is interested in you, tells you to "be careful" of
a rival interest, do you pay attention to that?

Buffy tries to save people who don't want to be saved.
"I am trying to save you! You are playing in some serious traffic here,
do you understand that? You're going to die! And the only hope you have of
surviving this is to get out of this pit right now, and, MY GOD, could you
have a dorkier outfit?"
What real-life situations parallel this?

I really like these two exchanges. Particularly from my older viewpoint. I thought
things would be easier when I grew up, but that's not the case at all.

* "Nothing's ever simple anymore. I'm constantly trying to work it out. Who to
  love or hate. Who to trust. It's just, like, the more I know, the more
  confused I get."
* "I believe that's called growing up."
* "I'd like to stop then, okay?"

* "Does it ever get easy?"
* "You mean life?"
* "Yeah. Does it get easy?"
* "What do you want me to say?"
* "Lie to me."
* "Yes, it's terribly simple. The good guys are always stalwart and true, the
  bad guys are easily distinguished by their pointy horns or black hats, and we
  always defeat them and save the day! No one ever dies, and everybody lives
  happily ever after.
* "Liar."

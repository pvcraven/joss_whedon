Paragraph Writing - Buffy Characters
====================================

The goal of the first assignment is to:

* Practice taking notes and turning that into an outline so you write a better
  paper, faster.
* Practice writing paragraphs.

Assignment One
--------------

Watch and discuss :ref:`welcome-to-the-hellmouth`.

* Select five characters in the episode we are about to watch
* Write one paragraph on each character
* No need for introduction, conclusion, or transition.
* Structure of each paragraph:

  * Purpose sentence (Name, who are they, what stereotype/purpose do they hold)
  * Analysis (Talk more about the purpose/motivation of character)
  * Supporting evidence (Support)

* In each paragraph:

  * What role is that character set up for?
  * What stereo-type?
  * Have you found people fix stereo types like this in school?
  * Shoot for about five sentences

How to Make Assignment One Easy
-------------------------------

* Outlining

  * Purpose is to save time and effort - NOT add more work
  * You know what you are writing about, write quick notes about
    the characters as you watch. Then the paragraphs should practically write themselves.

Due Date
--------

This assignment, and many of our others, will go through a revision phase. The
ability to revise your writing is an important part of writing well.

Turn in this assignment by Friday 8/28. By Tuesday, Robert will review the assignment
and provide feedback. Final turn-in should be done by Friday 9/4.

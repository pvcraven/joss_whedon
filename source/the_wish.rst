The Wish
========

Get up to date. Xander was dating Cordillia.
Cordillia had committed social suicide by dating Xander.
Cordillia caught Xander and Willow kissing.

Theme: The way-to-familiar feeling of being betrayed.
How does it make a person feel. Or if you are on the
other side.

"The reason you want to talk is so that you can feel
better about your self. You don't get that."

Wanting to 'get back'.
Wanting other people to see you happy.

Buffy told her friends how she felt, and it got better.
Why did that not work for Cordillia?

"I have to believe in a better world."
"Go ahead, I have to live in this one."

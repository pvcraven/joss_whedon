Short Essay - Out of Sight
==========================

Watch :ref:`out-of-sight`.

Pick one question to write about:

* Why is it common for students to feel ignored/invisible in high school, even when
  surrounded by people?

* Explain/contrast the difference between Buffy, Cordelia, and Marcy's experience
  in being popular?

Outline your essay.
During or after the episode start write down notes related to your
topic. During class discussion, do this same thing.

Group related items together. Make into an outline. Each group a paragraph.
Take the strongest four groupings. They'll be the four main paragraphs you put
in the essay.

Add an intro paragraph ahead of the four main paragraphs. Use it to
introduce the show/episode. Then quickly outline what you are
about to cover. Make sure your last sentence is the thesis.

Add a final sixth paragraph that is your conclusion. Do NOT introduce new
topics in the conclusion. Look back at your main points, and tie them together.
Don't just restate your four main paragraph points, but relate them together
into a final push to your conclusion. Make sure that conclusion answers your thesis.

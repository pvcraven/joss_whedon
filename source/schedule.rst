Out of Sight, Out of Mind
-------------------------

In this episode, the monster is the feeling of being alone and ignored by other
people in high school.

Pick one question to write about:

Why is it common for students to feel ignored/invisible in high school, even when
surrounded by people?

Explain/contrast the difference between Buffy, Cordelia, and Marcy's experience
in being popular?

While watching the episode start writing down notes on both these points that
you pick up from watching. During discussion, do this same thing. Pick one, organize
your notes.

Group related items together. Make into an outline. Each group a paragraph.
Take the strongest four groupings. They'll be four paragraphs.

In the intro paragraph, introduce the show/episode. Quickly outline what you are
about to cover, then last sentence is thesis.

* Opening scene, Buffy gets made fun of after bumping into Cordelia for being weird
* "Anger of the outcast" - schilock, "prick me, I bleed" (Maybe look this up?)

  running over kid, "my pain meant nothing"

  leaving new girl out.

* 'Have a nice summer?' -- kiss of death.
* "People perceived Marcy as invisible, so she became so"
* Not getting called on in class

  these losers"
* "It's all about me"

Innocence
=========

Before watching, make sure you are caught up on the plot.

* Why is spike in wheelchair.
* Who is blue Judge guy.
* What happened with Angel and Buffy having sex.
* Angel getting cursed with a soul, and losing it if he is ever truly happy.

Common concerns after first time having sex:

* Worry that everyone knows.
* Something changes afterwards?
* The other person doesn't get a hold of you afterwards?

The judge says "there's no humanity in him." What is humanity? Is it important
for people to have? How can you teach it? Where does it come from?

How can these Angel quotes apply to normal people:

* "She made me feel like a human being. That's not the kind of thing you
  just forgive."
* "To kill this girl... you have to love her."

* Xander: "We were just kissing, it doesn't mean that much."
* Willow: "It just means you'd rather be with someone you hate rather than me."

So, why do people blame themselves when someone else is the jerk? Why is
victim-blaming so effective?

* **Angelus:** What? I took off.
* **Buffy:** But you didn't say anything. You just left.
* **Angelus:** Yeah. Like I really wanted to stick around after that.
* **Buffy:** What?
* **Angelus:** You got a lot to learn about men, kiddo. Although I guess you proved that last night.
* **Buffy:** What are you saying?
* **Angelus:** Let's not make an issue out of it, okay? In fact, let's not talk about it at all. It happened.
* **Buffy:** I, I don't understand. Was it m-me? Was I not good?
* **Angelus:** You were great. Really. I thought you were a pro.

Discuss the quote: "It is not justice we serve. It is vengeance."

Willow to Xander: "Things are not ok between us. But there are other things
that are more important." What other situations arise, where you have to work
with someone who's betrayed you?

Do you think Oz's response is correct? What would you do if that happened?

* **Willow:** "Do you want to make out with me?"
* **Oz:** Well, to the casual observer, it would appear that you're trying to
  make your friend Xander jealous. Or even the score or something. And that's
  on the empty side... See, in my fantasy when I'm kissing you... you're
  kissing me... It's okay. I can wait. "

Giles is dating Jenny Calendar. When he realizes what Jenny has done, and Buffy
tells Jenny to get out, Giles has to pick sides.

"She said get out." Giles said. Buffy is like a kid to Giles. He picks his kid
over a romantic interest. Have you seen this play out in 'real' life? What would
you do? How hard would this decision be?

Buffy to Giles: "You must have been be so disappointed in me." How did Giles
respond? Was it a good response? How would you respond to a kid?

Think of the complexity of feelings Buffy must have had
when being held by a parent after having
a bad sex experience, and you don't have the comfort level with the parent to
discuss.

"There's no humanity in him."

"We were just kissing, it doesn't mean that much."
"It just means you'd rather be with someone you hate rather than me."

"It is not justice we serve. It is vengence."

"Things are not ok between us. But there are things that are more important."

The feeling of betrayal when you realize you've been used.

"You must have been be so dissappointed in me."

First Years - Assignment 5
==========================

This episode of Buffy delved into the situations first-year students, Buffy,
faced. As first-year students you have expectations when arriving on campus and
how your life will change and how you as a student will adapt and overcome these
obstacles. As you may have noticed by now your idea of college may or may not
have been correct.

In an essay explain
-------------------

* What these expectations you had of college were?
* What challenges you personally faced moving to college (ex, Moving away from
  home, procrastination, deadlines, etc.)
* How did you/will you overcome these obstacles you have/or will be put in
  front of?
* What are you hoping to gain from the "college experience?" (Other than a
  degree!!! Ex; friends, sense of self-worth, good work habits, etc..)
* How does this relate to Buffy in any way? (If possible)

Requirements
------------

This assignment should allow a wide spectrum to express yourself so take
advantage because most writings are purely academic in college. Have fun with
this paper and keep in mind the idea of ANALYSIS!!! This paper is structured
similar to a personal narrative so make sure to explain yourself and create a
really good analysis in each paragraph.

* Standard MLA format (12pt Times New Roman, double spaced).
* No max length of paper, I would rather read a longer more interesting and well
  thought out paper than a generic copy and paste feel.
* This paper should be as long as you need it to be so that you can express
  your ideas and get your point across.
* Follow the PIE method! (Purpose, Illustration, Explanation)
* Make sure to focus on your analysis, make this paper mean something to not
  only you but the audience.

Out of Sight, Out of Mind
=========================

Buffy is about taking "monsters" you encounter in high school and making them real

In this episode, the monster is the feeling of being alone and ignored by other
people in high school.

Story Arc
---------

The Harvest - Basically, there's a "master" vampire who is drawing strength from
his minions. They go and attack people at the Bronze, but Buffy and the gang
(later called the "Scooby Gang" come and save the day.
Jesse, Xander's friend, gets turned into a vampire and is killed.
Xander now really hates vampires.

Witch - Buffy tries to become a cheerleader. She doesn't make it, but cheerleaders
start having 'accidents'. Eventually we find Amy, a witch, is causing the accidents
to get on the cheerleading squad. In a twist, Amy is actually her mother Catherine, who
switched bodies with her in order to relive her 'glory' days.

Teacher's Pet - Dr Gregory from the school is killed by decapitation. The
substitute teacher, Ms. French, is quite attractive. She turns out to be a
praying mantis in disguise and almost kills Xander.

Never Kill a Boy on the First Date - Buffy tries to go on a date with Owen. Her
responsibilities as a vampire slayer keep getting in the way. Owen eventually
finds out Buffy's real job. He likes it, but from his attitude Buffy can tell
he'll end up getting himself killed.

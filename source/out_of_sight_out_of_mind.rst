Out of Sight, Out of Mind
=========================

Buffy is about taking "monsters" you encounter in high school and making them real
life monsters that Buffy and the Scooby gang fight.

In this episode, the monster is the feeling of being alone and ignored by other
people in high school.

Pick one question to write about:

Why is it common for students to feel ignored/invisible in high school, even when
surrounded by people?

Explain/contrast the difference between Buffy, Cordelia, and Marcy's experience
in being popular?

While watching the episode start writing down notes on both these points that
you pick up from watching. During discussion, do this same thing. Pick one, organize
your notes.

Group related items together. Make into an outline. Each group a paragraph.
Take the strongest four groupings. They'll be four paragraphs.

In the intro paragraph, introduce the show/episode. Quickly outline what you are
about to cover, then last sentence is thesis.

Discussion Points
-----------------

* Opening scene, Buffy gets made fun of after bumping into Cordelia for being weird
* "Anger of the outcast" - schilock, "prick me, I bleed" (Maybe look this up?)
* Cordelia - Miller isn't thinking about other people. What about her,
  running over kid, "my pain meant nothing"
* Teacher congratulating Cordelia, even if her stuff was bad
* Willow and Xander, laughing about inside joke, and "you had to be there"
  leaving new girl out.
* Cordelia and Harmony react aggressively when girl tries in engage in conversation
* What would you do if you could turn invisible?
* Wonderful power to possess. "I don't know, looking in the mirror every day and seeing nothing there"
* Popular people saying the same thing you do, and getting laughs "did you check out that toupe?"
* 'Have a nice summer?' -- kiss of death.
* "People perceived Marcy as invisible, so she became so"
* Not getting called on in class
* "I know we have differences and all, with you being weird and hanging out with
  these losers"
* "It's all about me"
* I don't care what it is, just get rid of it.
* "I can be surrounded by people and completely alone"
* "Beats being alone all by yourself"
* Suffering turns people loony?
* Someone saves your life, and still not going to join their social group
* What would you do if you were invisible?
* What makes this show "dated"? How is it different than what would happen today?

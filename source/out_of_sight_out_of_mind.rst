Out of Sight, Out of Mind
=========================

Buffy is about taking "monsters" you encounter in high school and making them real
life monsters that Buffy and the Scooby gang fight.

In this episode, the monster is the feeling of being alone and ignored by other
people in high school.

* Opening scene, Buffy gets made fun of after bumping into Cordelia for being weird
* "Anger of the outcast" - schilock, "prick me, I bleed" (Maybe look this up?)

  these losers"
* "It's all about me"
* I don't care what it is, just get rid of it.
